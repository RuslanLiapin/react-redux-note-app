# Note App React Redux

The provided code represents a Note App built using React and Redux. Users can create, edit, archive, and delete notes. The app employs routing via react-router-dom for different views. Redux manages state, with actions and reducers for note manipulation. The app features tab navigation, date extraction using regular expressions, and utilizes the Bulma CSS framework for styling. An initial note dataset is stored in the Redux store. The App component serves as the main entry point, rendering the UI layout and navigation tabs, while various views are presented based on the selected tab.
